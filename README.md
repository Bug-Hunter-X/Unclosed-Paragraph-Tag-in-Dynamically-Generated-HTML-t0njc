# Unclosed Paragraph Tag in Dynamically Generated HTML
This repository demonstrates a subtle HTML bug related to unclosed paragraph tags within dynamically generated content using JavaScript.  The bug is difficult to spot because browsers often attempt to correct the error, resulting in unexpected visual behavior.

The `bug.html` file shows the incorrect code, and `bugSolution.html` provides the corrected version.

## Bug Description
The bug arises from the missing closing `</p>` tag when dynamically adding a paragraph to a div element using `innerHTML`.  While the browser might render it correctly in simple cases, it can lead to inconsistencies and unexpected behavior, particularly within complex layouts or across different browsers.

## Solution
The solution involves ensuring all HTML tags are properly closed. Using DOM manipulation methods, like `document.createElement`, offers better control and helps avoid these types of errors.
